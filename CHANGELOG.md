# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added configurable keyboard shortcuts with recording, conflict reassignment, explicit unassignment, reserved-shortcut protection, persisted app-level bindings, immediate menu and visible-keycap updates, and layout-independent execution based on physical key positions.
- Added downloadable universal Apple Silicon and Intel DMG and ZIP builds with published SHA-256 checksums.

### Changed

- Replaced the built-in English and Russian demos with five-scene, anchor-first product showcases containing production plans, editing direction, and prepared local AI review notes; demo sessions now discard edits without prompts or autosave until explicitly saved as a project file.
- Made persisted Visuals and Editing relationships, grouping, selection, and marker navigation anchor-first; legacy segment-only links migrate when projects load, and invalid relationships appear as unlinked instead of pointing at stale script text.
- Simplified Settings and launch behavior, added a persisted inline-autocomplete control, and enabled AI review and inline autocomplete by default for new or reset settings while preserving existing saved preferences.
- Consolidated project exit and project-browser navigation into Back to Project List.

### Fixed

- Fixed v0.3.0 production-anchor repair, grouping, selection, and marker geometry so ordinary script edits keep unambiguous links aligned and stale or ambiguous relationships are cleared safely.
- Fixed v0.3.0 inline-autocomplete wrapping and editor geometry so ghost text respects TextKit layout, whitespace, paragraph spacing, and narrow-line boundaries.

### Removed

- Removed adjustable script-column width and line spacing in favor of a responsive 900 pt maximum text column and fixed typography.
- Removed the footer-shortcuts preference and footer shortcut bar; active shortcuts remain available in menus, controls, the command palette, and the shortcuts overlay.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Added inline AI autocomplete at the logical end of a script, with debounced one-sentence ghost text, Tab acceptance, Escape dismissal, IME awareness, stale-request cancellation, provider cooldowns, and localized availability details.
- Added Google AI Studio as a configurable AI provider for connection tests, AI review, rewrites, autocomplete, and production suggestions.
- Added controls to remove individual Recent Projects or clear the list without deleting project files.

### Changed

- Renamed user-facing production-footage terminology to Visuals (Видеоряд in Russian) across workspaces, AI output, exports, demo content, and current documentation while preserving compatible project-file keys.
- Changed saved-project autosave to coalesce rapid edits while editor text and live metrics commit immediately.
- Unified localized error and recovery presentation for project, settings, export, Keychain, Recent Project, and AI operations.
- Changed AI review to request and validate structured responses, preserve earlier results on failed retries, and follow the script language with the macOS language as fallback.
- Changed provider credential access so Settings uses saved-key metadata and a selected provider key is read from Keychain only for a connection test or AI request, then cached in memory until replaced or deleted.

### Fixed

- Fixed script text loss and stale-text replacement during mode, scene, window, desktop, and app-activity transitions; caret, selection, and scroll restoration are now kept per scene and editor window and clamped after shorter external updates.
- Fixed script caret, placeholder, and editor-column alignment, including insertion geometry in empty paragraphs.
- Fixed Script production-marker grouping and TextKit geometry so separate Visuals and Editing ranges retain their right-side lanes and individual hit targets.
- Fixed live word counts and scene, sidebar, and project duration estimates so they update on every committed edit, including untitled projects before save.
- Fixed the existing Script, Visuals, and Editing mode controls so their full visible surfaces are clickable and accessibility state is localized.
- Fixed Recent Project migration, bookmark validation, missing-file cleanup, unchanged-storage rewrites, and failure handling without discarding preserved legacy data.
- Fixed Keychain replacement and deletion error handling, including explicit replacement of legacy restricted entries.
- Fixed existing-provider AI review compatibility for token-truncated or harmlessly wrapped structured responses, including Groq JSON variants, while keeping parser diagnostics out of user-facing errors.
- Fixed autosave, sandbox export-folder bookmarks, settings persistence, and other critical file-operation failures that were previously silent or insufficiently recoverable.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10
